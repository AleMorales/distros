# distros

This package implements alternative versions of some statistical distributions. 
Internally, the d/p/q/r functions are used, but the distributions are always
parameterized by the mean, coefficient of variation and other scale parameters.
To distinguish these functions from the original ones, there are all prefixed by
a 2. 

Distributions currently implemented:

- Lognormal
- Beta
